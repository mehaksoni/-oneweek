Sex trafficking is one of the most horrible crimes and is something we should all get together to try and solve. We are building an app that can, through crowdsourcing, help identify places that are targets of sex trafficking.

Interface-wise:
-Each user should be able to mark a particular residence/house which they think could be a target of trafficking.

-One user should not be able to see what areas any other user has marked (because users would have privacy concerns. Also if things are anonymized, then there is no credibility, or the possibility to extend the app later and provide a “credit history” for each user)

-The police force should get a heat map kind of view about the sex trafficking regions and their density. So if multiple people marked a particular place/area, that would help the police organize the priority they could investigate in.

-Data Visualization + Azure Machine learning- can help us in incredible ways to understand patterns, and maybe over time be able to understand + predict trends better
